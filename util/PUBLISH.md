# Publish Steps

* Run `npm install`, `npm update` to get the latest versions of dependencies.
* Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version number, publish date, and all changes.
* Update `package.json`, specifically the `version` field.
* If the glTF Language Server changed at all, bump its own `version` number in `server/package.json`.
* In PowerShell, run `vsce publish` to actually publish to the marketplace.
* Add a git tag for the release.  For example: `git tag -a 2.2.0 -m "Release version 2.2.0"`
* Push the branch & tag. `git push --tags`

**NOTE:** It is best to run `vsce` in PowerShell, not Git Bash, due to TTY differences.
