# Publish Steps

* Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version number, publish date, and all changes.
* Update `package.json`, specifically the `version` field.
* Copy the new `version` number to `server/package.json`.
* Run `npm install`, `npm update` to get the latest versions of dependencies.
* Git commit the results of these edits and package-lock changes.
* Open the project and run `task watch` to recompile if needed.
* In PowerShell, run `vsce package`.
  * Compare the new package size to previous, to see if any new large files got added via npm.
  * Test the release package by installing it manually in `{user}/.vscode/extensions`.
* In PowerShell, run `vsce publish` to actually publish to the marketplace.
* Add a git tag for the release.  For example: `git tag -a 2.3.0 -m "Release version 2.3.0"`
* Push the branch & tag. `git push --tags`

**NOTE:** It is best to run `vsce` in PowerShell, not Git Bash, due to TTY differences.
