## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can merge a pull request, we require a signed Contributor License Agreement.  There is a CLA for:

* [individuals](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/Documentation/Contributors/CLAs/individual-cla-agi-v1.0.txt) and
* [corporations](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/Documentation/Contributors/CLAs/corporate-cla-agi-v1.0.txt).

This only needs to be completed once, and enables contributions to all of the projects under the [Analytical Graphics Inc](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc) organization.  The CLA ensures you retain copyright to your contributions, and provides us the right to use, modify, and redistribute your contributions using the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE.md).

Please email a completed CLA with all fields filled in to [cla@agi.com](mailto:cla@agi.com).  Related questions are also welcome.

## CHANGELOG.md

Please add bullet point(s) for changes or new features to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.  The publish date can be left as `UNRELEASED` since
the release is not on any set schedule, and likely will not happen on the same day that the pull request is created.
