## TODO

This extension is not officially supported by any entity, and no promise is made that any ideas or feature requests here will ever get implemented.  This is just a wish-list.

### Add color and skyBox choices to model preview

### Save camera location in model view, with home button

### Add shader preview/edit/export/import

### Add image preview/export/import

* Make sure image & shader tools work with code folding, for example if a particular image or shader is folded closed at the innermost level, ideally the user could still preview/edit/export/import it.

### Add code snippets for new technique, new texture, etc.
