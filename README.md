# glTF Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds features for previewing and editing 3D models
in [glTF files](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF).

The glTF standard is maintained by Khronos, the same standards body behind OpenGL and WebGL.  They describe glTF as follows:

> glTFâ„¢ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.

## Features

* Preview glTF files with `ALT+G`
* Tooltips and auto-complete for glTF enums

## Extension Settings
